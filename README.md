# Project Approval System

## Description

The Project Approval System is a web application that aims to enable better collaboration between an academic faculty and their students. The application allows students to submit project proposals and have them approved by a faculty member. The system is designed to be used by faculty who will be responsible for reviewing and approving project proposals submitted by students. The system will allow students to submit project proposals, view the status of their proposals, withdraw a proposal, receive, and respond to feedback from reviewers.
